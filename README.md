# Ominous

Ominous is a little background application I've developed to prank a friend. Essentially, it checks if `javaw.exe` [normally Minecraft] is running, and picks a time interval between 30m-45m to play 1 of 5 sounds.

This probably will be developed a bit more, but the core of the joke is already done and put in a VM I've made for a friend to play Minecraft in to troll them.

If said friend sees this, hi, your girlfriend was in on this and many of our friends were in on it as well :p
